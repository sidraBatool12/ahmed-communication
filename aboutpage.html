                        Once the founder of Ahmed Communications (Pvt) Ltd. (ACPL) Late, Mr. Arif Manan expressed, as I
                        am not a well-educated man but I can write a history with my passion that would be the way of
                        people who believe that opportunity is not born itself rather, it is to pull from the hole of
                        risks with courage and patience. ACPL is approaching its 15th year. Today where we stand; is the
                        vision of a person who always believed and was saying “your work is going to fill a large part
                        of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
                        And the only way to do great work is to love what you do”. These words are the driving tools of
                        our company that Late Mr. Arif Manan used to say. Mr. Arif Manan was a person who loved to set
                        new trends in the business especially, in the horizon of entrepreneurship, he always encouraged
                        the people who have the spark of doing something, he used to make people understand that success
                        is not only the money rather it is making something happen. He always believed in change, he
                        used to say a special mindset cannot bring a notable change. He always gave new meanings to
                        business risks and ventures, one of his daring statements is “I THINK and ACT as if I am ALREADY
                        SUCCESSFUL”. Continuing the legacy of our founder, we are hopefully in the pursuit of a bright
                        future. We must thank him for the company we are today.

                    <p class="about-text">
                        Late, Mr. Abid Manan was an associate co-founder of the company. He assumed the responsibilities
                        of ensuring the consistency in company’s vision and making sure that it is unique and attractive
                        to potential customers, also he concentrated on creating value for customers through expansion
                        of sales outlets and customer service initiatives. He believed that the outcome is more
                        important than the process, that’s why we found him always rushing to get more of whatever he
                        focused on. He was more than a decisive man, proactive and always believes in smart
                        presentation. He always said “I am trying my best to run the company otherwise the company will
                        be running me and that day will be a super bad one for all of us. “We must know when not to
                        decide” was his famous phrase while discussing business, particularly the marketing strategies.
                        He made us learnt to create a pull in the sales rather than pushing it through investing more
                        resources.
